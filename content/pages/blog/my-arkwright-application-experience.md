## ![](https://preview--interesting-chili-f8ad4.stackbit.dev/\_static/app-assets/images/Arkwright%20Graphic.png)What is Arkwright?

> An Arkwright Engineering Scholarship is the most esteemed scholarship of its type in the UK, designed to inspire students to pursue their dreams and change the world as a future leader in engineering.

From [https://www.arkwright.org.uk/](https://www.arkwright.org.uk/Who)

# Who can apply?

*   You must have a strong desire to have a future career as a leader within the Engineering Profession

*   When you apply, you must be in the school year in which you will sit your GCSEs, Scottish National 5s, International Baccalaureate Standards, BTEC level 2s or equivalent exams

*   You must intend to stay at school or sixth form college for two years to study A levels, BTEC level 3 Diploma/Extended Diploma, Scottish Highers / Advanced Highers or the International Baccalaureate higher level

*   Unless studying for a BTEC Level 3 in engineering, applicants must make a commitment to study one of the following subjects to A level (England, Wales & Northern Ireland), or Advanced Higher (Scotland):

    *   Engineering Science

    *   Maths

    *   Physics

    *   Computer Science

## &#xA;What are the benefits?

As part of the programme, Scholars will:

*   Receive a coveted two-year Arkwright Engineering Scholarship which is widely respected by
    academia and industry

*   Receive a financial award of £300 per year, to help with the cost of materials, equipment and
    activities to optimise their studies towards a career in Engineering

*   Gain access to a wide range of enrichment events and opportunities through The Smallpeice
    Trust including Connect Days, summer schools and technical lectures.

*   Receive a dedicated mentor to support them through their Scholarship

## How did I become aware of Arkwright?

I was first introduced to Arkwright by the Physics Department at Wilson's School when I started Year 11. Shortly after, they asked us to pitch an idea of a project which we would plan to submit to Arkwright. I pitched my project idea of an alarmed bike lock and explained why I was a suitable candidate. All students from Year 11 were nominated by the school to apply.

## My online application

From 15/12/20, I had to prepare my project (more details given in a future article). The deadline given to us was 15/01/21 which only gave me a month to complete my project and write a report. For this reason, I would advise future applicants to have pre-prepared their project for Arkwright so that you have a lot more time and flexibility. Don't leave this to the last minute like I did!

The Arkwright Online Application Form has 4 main sections

1.  **Beyond School**: This requires you to explain your preferred discipline of engineering, what inspired you and your career aspirations.

2.  **STEM Project:** This requires you to write up a detailed report of your project which displays aptitude in your chosen discipline of engineering.

3.  **Engineering Interests:** This requires you to give details of any current or recent interests, activities, hobbies or projects that you have participated in which    demonstrate your engineering interests.

4.  **Leadership Skills:** This requires you to provide examples of where you have shown leadership, e.g. mentoring, DofE, volunteering.

Your application will be marked out of 50 marks and will determine whether you are allocated an interview. For more help with this, see my linked resources at the bottom of the article which includes a guide, an admissions form and example projects with examiner feedback.

## Arkwright Aptitude Exam

Due to the extension of lockdown in the UK to March 2021, the 2021 Aptitude Exam was cancelled.

In normal circumstances, the Exam encourages students to demonstrate their skills by producing innovative solutions to
engineering design problems. The Exam is broad-based and requires applicants to use the full spectrum of their knowledge of engineering. Applicants must sit the Exam on the afternoon of the first Wednesday in February.

I strongly advise applicants to have a look at past papers to prepare for the questions. These can be found here: <https://www.arkwright.org.uk/how-to-apply/aptitude-exam>

The Aptitude Exam is graded and the grade of the Exam and the Application is combined to determine who gets allocated an interview.

## My interview

In normal circumstances, Arkwright interviews would be held at a university. However, due to the pandemic, my interview was held online via Microsoft Teams on 26/04/21. Roughly 600 students progressed to the interview stage.

For my interview, I was asked to prepare a presentation with the following specifications:

*   Details of what the STEM project you talked about in your application

*   Information in the form of pictures, graphics and text that helps to explain the project to the interviewers

*   Images of the project as it is now showing any progression since you wrote about it in the application

*   Information in the form of pictures, graphics and text that demonstrate your wider interests in engineering

I delivered my presentation in the first half of the interview. I had 2 interviewers who questioned me about my project. For example, they asked what materials I used in my construction and why I used them.

In the second half, the interviewers questioned me about my wider engineering interests. Potential lines of questioning are: why you want to become an engineer, who or what inspired you, why you are interested in your chosen area of engineering, where and what you plan to study as well as what your ideal job would be. They may also ask you what the scholarship would mean to you.

**General tips:**

*   Be polite, enthusiastic and communicate well

*   Make sure you are knowledgeable about your project and your preferred engineering discipline

*   Show a genuine interest and commitment to a career in engineering

## What lays ahead for me?

My Arkwright Application is now fully complete. I will be informed if I have been successful, or not, in securing a Scholarship with Arkwright by the end of September 2021.
