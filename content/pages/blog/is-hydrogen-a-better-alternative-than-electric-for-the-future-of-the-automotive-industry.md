“In order to have clean air in cities, you have to go electric,” Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, once stated in an interview with the CNN when questioned about the future of the automotive industry in China. \[1] However, whilst Tesla is currently leading in the production of sustainable energy vehicles, is electric really the future of automobiles?

Electric cars first became commercially available in 1996 when General Motors released the EV1. Indeed, over 1000 of these cars were mass-produced as part of the programme, but by 2003, the program was axed by GM due to the high development costs and the low 50-mile range. Consequently, most of these cars were removed from the roads and destroyed \[2]. Since then, however, new companies like Tesla, as well as already well-known car companies such as BMW, Audi and Jaguar, have begun to develop electric cars to replace the heavily polluting petrol and diesel cars on our roads today. Tesla began their journey in the industry in 2008 by releasing the Roadster – a luxury, sports car which used lithium-ion cells to power its reported 3.7s 0-60mph time and 244 mile range \[3].This was an unprecedented development in the industry and helped to fuel the company’s future as they later released the Model S (2012), X (2015), 3 (2017) and Y (2019) in addition to the Cybertruck and Semi-truck. Currently, Tesla has a global market share of roughly 18% amongst electric car producers, with the Model 3 being the most sold electric car ever (over 800 000 sold as of December 2020). Despite this significant development within recent years, as of 2019, electric car sales only accounted for 2.6% of global car sales \[4].

The main downfalls of electric vehicles currently include slow charging times, low range on a single charge and the lack of charging infrastructure across the globe. The recently announced Tesla Model S Plaid+, the EV with the longest range in the current market, only has a marketed range of around 520 miles. Whilst this is long enough for the average daily commute, it is much shorter than the convenience of having over 800 miles of range with a more conventional petrol or diesel car. Furthermore, on average it takes 45 minutes to fully charge with the use of a 250kW supercharger \[5]  whereas the regular 7kW charger can take over 8 hours to fill the car’s battery. This is therefore a major disadvantage which the hydrogen-based car may be able to overcome.

In 1959, Francis Bacon, an engineer at Cambridge University, created and demonstrated the first hydrogen fuel-cell which could be used for an automotive. A fuel-cell vehicle (FCV) produces energy through the exothermic reaction of compressed hydrogen gas and oxygen in a process known as reverse electrolysis – a process where hydrogen gas is split into protons and electrons at the anode with a platinum catalyst before reacting with oxygen at the cathode, therefore creating an electrical current \[6]. This results only in the production of water and no other harmful gases, including carbon dioxide as well as nitrogen oxides or sulfur dioxide due to the low running temperature of the hydrogen fuel cell. Indeed, the process which occurs in the fuel cell is very efficient as there are no moving parts, like in an internal combustion engine, and energy isn’t lost as thermal energy to the surroundings. Not too dissimilar to most EVs, FCVs are currently limited to just over 300 miles of range \[7], but this can be scaled up in the future with larger hydrogen tanks. However, the largest current downfall of this zero-emission technology is the significant lack of refuelling stations – as of September 2020, there are only 80 stations in Germany and only 40 across the entire USA in contrast to over 20 000 EV charging stations \[8].

Other potential shortfalls of the hydrogen car include the potential carbon footprint of producing the required hydrogen gas and the possibly fatal dangers of pressurised flammable hydrogen. Hydrogen is produced most commonly through natural gas reforming where, when exposed to steam, methane separates into carbon and hydrogen, ultimately resulting in the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. An alternative method includes the electrolysis of water, yet, due to the high magnitudes of electricity required, it can also create a large carbon footprint. This highly flammable and volatile hydrogen gas is often stored in pressurised tanks which can potentially be very disastrous if an accident occurs. Notably, in May 1937, the Hindenburg passenger airship exploded, killing 36 people, as a result of the accidental combustion of hydrogen gas whilst trying to dock the airship. On the other hand, according to a Toyota spokesperson at a 2014 auto show, in the case of a leak in the fuel tank, “the hydrogen gas would instantaneously dissipate into the atmosphere” as a consequence of being stored at 10000 psi and being 16 times lighter than air, potentially making the hydrogen car much safer than a petrol or diesel car which we see commonly on our roads today \[9].

Furthermore, both electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles are largely advantageous as they produce zero harmful emissions – the major flaw which the combustion engines in most cars today has. With the current plan to ban all petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 in the UK, automotive companies will continue to develop their technology as many nations work to reduce their net carbon emissions to minimise the devastating effects of global warming. Another similarity is their low noise, increasing passenger comfort whilst also diminishing road noise pollution, which increases the feeling of quality and provides a more luxury experience inside their cars.

In conclusion, electric vehicles are currently the better option compared to hydrogen cars for the future of the automotive industry. This is mainly due to their head-start with companies, such as Tesla, striving in the market. Despite the hydrogen car’s faster fuelling times and opportunity for longer driving ranges, electric cars have the benefit of having an existing infrastructure and a community which has been building up for over the last decade. Therefore, as Elon Musk said in his interview, electric cars will most likely be the future of most people’s vehicles, but hydrogen cars are always welcome for a more sustainable and environmentally.
