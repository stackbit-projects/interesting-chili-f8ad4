Sustainable cities. Affordable and clean energy. Urgent climate action. These are just three of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals which the United Nations set out in 2015 to be achieved by 2030 for the “peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future” \[1]. Notably, many countries, including the UK, are targeting net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2050. Therefore, how must these countries gradually transition so that we all live in more environmentally-friendly, sustainable
cities?

## Greener Cities

The city of Copenhagen in Denmark is one of the most sustainable and energy efficient cities across the globe. All as part of
Copenhagen’s goal to be the first carbon-neutral city, they have made large technological advancements as well as much simpler but still effective ones.  As simple as just the national consensus to use bicycles for commutes rather than drive polluting cars across the city. However, much more innovative solutions such as the £610 million Amager Bakke Waste-to-Energy Plant Project which burns waste collected from 500,000 to 700,000 inhabitants and 46,000 companies in and around Copenhagen, have also helped the city to a great extent. Whilst providing in excess of 150 000 Danish homes energy throughout the year, the plant also acts as a social and cultural hub with activities such as the CopenHill artificial ski slope, an 80m-high rock-climbing wall and a running track \[2].

All of the city’s impactful efforts have consequently accumulated to Copenhagen winning the European Green Capital Award back in 2014 and striding towards the finish line to be the first carbon-neutral city in the world. 



## Clean Energy

Today, approximately 26% of the world’s energy is derived from renewable sources but as fossil fuel supplies dwindle and energy consumption increases, affordable and clean energy is augmenting in importance. One striking example is Kenya where over 70% of their energy is renewable after over US $1.3 billion was spent in 2010 alone to construct infrastructure technologies utilising the energy in wind, geothermal, small-scale hydro and biofuel stores \[3]. These sustainable developments are crucial to
supply electricity with the nation’s energy demand raising by 6-8% per annum as well as providing approximately 260 000 jobs. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, has relied on 41.2% fossil fuels and only 25.4% renewable energy on average over
the last year\[4].[\[1\]](#\_msocom\_1)  Will the UK be able to sustainably generate the extra 263GW required by 2050 whilst still meeting their goal of being carbon-neutral by then?  



## Electric Vehicle Infrastructure

With the looming ban of selling petrol and diesel cars in 2030, it is increasingly important for countries to prepare for this transition by redeveloping our transport infrastructure with more efficient public transport systems, increased bicycle lanes and more electric vehicles stations. Where is your nearest electric car charging point? Indeed, whilst some may even have one already installed in their driveway, others may not be able to locate one within a 5 mile radius from their home. In the UK, currently there are over 35 000 charging points across 13 000 locations \[5]. In contrast, there are reportedly 8385 petrol stations operational in the UK, so taking the average of 12 fuel pumps per station, that equates to over 100 000 fuelling points \[6]. Furthermore, other countries across the globe have much less infrastructure, Singapore having almost no electric vehicle
infrastructure.

On the other hand, Norway is a key example of a country which has successfully taken on board the electric vehicle revolution.
In 2020, 54.2% of all car sales were of electric vehicles - the first time such cars have comprised more than 50% of new car sales in a country across a full year \[7]. This parallels the rapid development of charging infrastructure with over 16 000 points available for a population of only 5.3 million. Moreover, Norway plans by 2025 to have at least two fast-charging stations per every 50km of road, in addition to plans to introduce wireless charging under main roads in the capital of Oslo \[8]. Should the
UK’s government follow Norway’s lead for a more sustainable future? 

Therefore, as our population continues to rise, how will cities continue to develop in a sustainable manner? Whether it be through large, innovative projects such as Copenhagen’s Amager Bakke Project, cleaner sources of energy or even the implementation of more efficient EV infrastructure, countries must work together in this crucial fight towards carbon net-zero by the year 2050.
