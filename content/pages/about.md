Hi, I'm Alex Wang, a Sixth Form student at Wilson's School, South London. I am approaching my final years of secondary education and will be applying to university soon. I created this website to share tips about studying and to help other students in my situation to succeed academically. I will be posting regular articles on technology and maths, as well as providing exclusive insight into my projects and experiences.

## Credentials

I have full secondary education from Wilson's School, with 12 GCSE's.

My experience of privately tutoring maths and English has taught me to explain complex concepts in a friendly and non-intimidating way. I tutor students from ages 10-16 in the UK and China.

## My Interests

I am a keen mathematician. I enjoy taking part in UKMT math competitions. In the past 3 years, I have qualified for all 3 UKMT Math Olympiads. In 2021-2022 I will be participating in many more maths and computer science competitions. My aspiration is to study maths or computer science at Oxbridge. 

Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, music and exploring nature. I am classically trained in violin and piano, having reached ABRSM Grade 8 in both instruments. To relax, I often explore my local parks and countryside by bike.
